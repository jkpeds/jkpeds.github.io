</header>


{% capture include_content %}
- We are a warm, friendly, small office, very family oriented.

- We offer same or next day appointments for urgent concerns.

- When calling, you speak directly to someone in the office and not a call-center.

- We are timely in responding to requests for specialist referrals, copies of health records, immunizations, etc.

- We welcome out-of-town college students in need of a local physician to treat chronic medical issues (including prescribing psychiatric and ADHD medications).

- We accept most health insurance plans.

- Patients and parents are all treated with respect and empathy.
